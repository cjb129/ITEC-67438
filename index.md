### Background

My name is Cory Boveington. This is my first class in the ITEC program. I look forward to meeting all of you online.
I live in Cuyahoga Falls, OH and I work at Kent State as an Associate Application Developer. I graduated from The University of Akron with a Bachellor's in Computer Science. I have no background in education or instructional design.

### Hobbies

I enjoy reading, target shooting with a bow and arrow, and playing with my cat. ```I also love programming``` and all things related. My favorite book is probably Fight Club, by Chuck Palahniuk, because it's quick and exciting. If I had to choose a favorite series it would be A Song of Ice and Fire.

### Travels

In high school I travelled to Argentina for 1 year during my junior year. I've been to Colorado a few times to visit friends and family. My sister lives in South Carolina, so I frequently visit Hilton Head as well.

### Goals

I'd love to work for an educational tech company. Kahn Academy, edX, Coursera, Udacity, Pluralsight, Lynda. Those are some of the bigger companies, but I'm sure there's a ton of others out there. Part of the reason I enrolled in this program was to gain some domain specific knowledge in ed tech.
